Contributing to LXQt
====================

The LXDE team is always looking for contributors. Everyone is welcome to join,
whether they are a developer, translator or user.


Code contributions
------------------

LXDE uses Git as a version control system. All our code is available online:
  http://git.lxde.org/

Aspiring contributors may choose to use our Github mirrors instead.
Pull Requests directly from Github are accepted.
  https://github.com/LXDE

For more information on git, see the official website:
  http://git-scm.com/

Please make sure you adhere to the project's styleguide when proposing changes.


Translations
------------

We use Pootle for all our translations.
  http://pootle.lxde.org/

For more information on Pootle, please see the official documentation:
  http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/


Bug reports
-----------

All our issues are tracked on Github.
Please file all general LXQt bug reports on the general LXDE-Qt bug tracker:
  https://github.com/lxde/lxde-qt.

Some components, such as QtXDG, have their own issue tracker on Github:
