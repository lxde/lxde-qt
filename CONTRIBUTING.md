Contributing to LXQt
====================

The LXDE team is always looking for contributors. Everyone is welcome to join,
whether they are a developer, translator or user.


Code contributions
------------------

LXDE uses Git as a version control system. All our code is available online:
  http://git.lxde.org/

Aspiring contributors may choose to use our Github mirrors instead.
Pull Requests directly from Github are accepted.
  https://github.com/LXDE

For more information on git, see the official website:
  http://git-scm.com/

Please make sure you adhere to the project's styleguide when proposing changes.

A more in-depth document for aspiring contributors is located on the LXQt wiki:

Translations
------------

We use Pootle for all our translations.
  http://pootle.lxde.org/

For more information on Pootle, please see the official documentation:
  http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/

NOTE: Due to issues regarding pootle.lxde.org translators are asked to commit temporarily on GitHub. Pootle server will be deployed again some time after LXQt 0.9 is released.
